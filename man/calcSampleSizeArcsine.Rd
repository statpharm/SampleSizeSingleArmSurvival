\title{Calculate Sample Size Using Arcsine Transformation}
\usage{
calcSampleSizeArcsine(
  S0,
  S1,
  alpha = 0.05,
  power = 0.8,
  accrual = 24,
  followup = 24,
  timePoint = 18,
  steps = 10000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{S0}{Numeric. Survival probability under the null hypothesis (strictly between 0 and 1).}

\item{S1}{Numeric. Survival probability under the alternative hypothesis (strictly between 0 and 1).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Type I error rate for one-sided test. Default is 0.05.}

\item{power}{Numeric. Desired power of the test (1 - beta). Default is 0.80.}

\item{accrual}{Numeric. Duration of accrual in months. Default is 24.}

\item{followup}{Numeric. Additional follow-up duration in months. Default is 24.}

\item{timePoint}{Numeric. Time of interest in months. Default is 18.}

\item{steps}{Integer. Number of steps for numeric integration if timePoint exceeds follow-up. Default is 10000.}
}
\value{
Integer. The required sample size (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
}
\description{
This function calculates the required sample size for single-arm survival studies
based on the arcsine transformation method. It accounts for uniform accrual and
exponential survival, including numeric integration for time points exceeding the follow-up period.
}
\examples{
# Calculate sample size for typical survival probabilities
calcSampleSizeArcsine(S0 = 0.90, S1 = 0.96)

# Adjusting for lower survival probabilities and longer accrual
calcSampleSizeArcsine(S0 = 0.80, S1 = 0.85, accrual = 36, followup = 12, timePoint = 24)
}
